    <p>Custom Design is all about creating unique and tailored solutions that meet the specific needs of clients. 
        It involves understanding the client's vision, goals, and preferences to craft designs that are not only visually 
        appealing but also functional and user-friendly. By focusing on customization, we ensure that every project stands out 
        and delivers a personalized experience that resonates with the target audience.</p>
    <p>Web design with responsive layout and SEO optimization ensures that websites are not only visually appealing 
        but also highly functional and accessible across all devices. A responsive layout adapts seamlessly to different 
        screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. 
        Coupled with SEO optimization, it enhances the website's visibility on search engines, driving more traffic 
        and improving user engagement. Together, these elements create a powerful combination that meets both user 
        expectations and business goals.</p>

    <p>Responsive Layout is a design approach that ensures websites and applications adapt seamlessly to different 
        screen sizes and devices. By using flexible grids, images, and CSS media queries, responsive layouts provide an 
        optimal viewing experience for users, whether they are on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This approach not only 
        enhances usability but also improves accessibility, making it a crucial aspect of modern web design.</p>

    <section id="seo_optimization" class="main-section"><header>SEO Optimization</header>
    <p>SEO Optimization, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of enhancing a website's visibility and
         ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves a combination of strategies, techniques, 
         and best practices aimed at improving the quality and quantity of organic traffic to a website.
          By optimizing various elements of a website, businesses can ensure that their content is easily discoverable 
          by search engines and relevant to users' search queries.</p>
    <p>One of the key aspects of SEO is keyword research, which involves identifying the terms and phrases that potential
         users are searching for. These keywords are then strategically incorporated into the website's content, meta tags,
         headings, and URLs to improve its relevance to search engines. Additionally, creating high-quality, engaging,
          and informative content is crucial for attracting and retaining visitors, as well as earning backlinks from other
           reputable websites.</p>
    <p>Technical SEO focuses on optimizing the website's structure and performance to ensure it is easily crawlable 
        and indexable by search engine bots. This includes improving page load speed, ensuring mobile-friendliness, 
        using secure HTTPS protocols, and fixing broken links or duplicate content issues. A well-structured website 
        with a clear hierarchy and proper use of schema markup can significantly enhance its search engine visibility.</p>
    <p>Another important component of SEO is off-page optimization, which involves building a strong online presence and 
        reputation through link building, social media engagement, and other external factors. Earning high-quality backlinks
         from authoritative websites signals to search engines that the website is trustworthy and valuable, which can
          positively impact its rankings.</p>
    <p>SEO is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, analysis, and adaptation to stay ahead of 
        competitors and keep up with search engine algorithm updates. By investing in SEO, businesses can improve their 
        online visibility, drive targeted traffic, and ultimately achieve their marketing and business goals.</p>

    <section id="future" class="main-section"><header>The Future</header>
    <p>The future of web design is being profoundly shaped by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). 
        AI-powered tools are enabling designers to create more personalized, efficient, and innovative user experiences. 
        From AI-driven design assistants that generate layouts and color schemes to machine learning algorithms that analyze 
        user behavior and optimize interfaces, the possibilities are endless.</p>
    <p>One of the key trends is the rise of conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants,
         which are becoming integral to modern web design. These AI-driven features provide users with instant support
          and enhance engagement by offering a more interactive experience.</p>
    <p>Additionally, AI is revolutionizing accessibility in web design. Tools that automatically generate alt text for images, 
        transcribe audio content, and adapt interfaces for users with disabilities are making the web more inclusive than ever 
        before.</p>
    <p>As AI continues to evolve, web designers will increasingly rely on predictive analytics to anticipate user needs 
        and deliver content that is both relevant and timely. This shift towards data-driven design will not only improve 
        user satisfaction but also drive business success.</p>
    <p>In the environment of AI, the future of web design is a blend of creativity and technology, where human ingenuity
         is augmented by intelligent systems to create experiences that are both functional and inspiring.</p>
    <p>Web design and marketing offer small businesses an incredible opportunity to level the playing field with larger 
        competitors. By leveraging modern tools and strategies, small businesses can create visually stunning websites that
         effectively communicate their brand and values. Coupled with targeted marketing efforts, they can reach their ideal
          audience, build meaningful connections, and drive growth. The digital landscape empowers small businesses to showcase 
          their unique strengths, foster customer loyalty, and achieve success in ways that were once unimaginable.</p>

        <p id="result">Upload an image and click "Analyze Image" to see AI in action.</p>

                if (input.files.length === 0) {
                    document.getElementById('result').textContent = 'Please upload an image first.';
                    return;
                }

                const file = input.files[0];
                const reader = new FileReader();
                reader.onload = async () => {
                    const imageData = reader.result;

                    // Simulated AI analysis (replace with actual AI API call)
                    const simulatedResult = 'Detected objects: Cat, Chair, Table';
                    document.getElementById('result').textContent = simulatedResult;
                };
                reader.readAsDataURL(file);
